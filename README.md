# Stock Market Analysis Bot

A Python-based trading bot for analyzing stock market data, calculating technical indicators, and generating buy/sell/hold signals based on simple trading strategies. The bot uses the [`yfinance`](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library to fetch stock data and the [`ta`](https://pypi.org/project/ta/) library for technical analysis.

## Features

- Fetches historical stock data for any ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple).
- Calculates key technical indicators:
  - Simple Moving Averages (SMA: 20-day and 50-day).
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI: 14-day).
  - Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD).
- Generates trading signals based on:
  - SMA crossover strategy (Buy: SMA20 > SMA50, Sell: SMA20 < SMA50).
  - RSI thresholds (Buy: RSI < 30, Sell: RSI > 70).
  - MACD crossover (Buy: MACD > Signal, Sell: MACD < Signal).
- Provides a clear recommendation (Buy, Sell, or Hold) based on combined signals.
- Access to historical data for further analysis or visualization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher.
- Required Python libraries:
  - `yfinance`: For fetching stock data from Yahoo Finance.
  - `ta`: For calculating technical indicators.
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-market-analysis-bot.git
   cd stock-market-analysis-bot
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install yfinance ta pandas numpy
   ```

## Usage

1. Save the bot code in a file, e.g., `stock_bot.py`.
2. Run the bot with a specific stock ticker, period, and interval:
   ```python
   from stock_bot import StockBot

   # Initialize bot for Apple (AAPL) with 1 year of daily data
   bot = StockBot(symbol="AAPL", period="1y", interval="1d")

   # Run analysis
   bot.analyze()
   ```

3. Example output:
   ```
   Stock Analysis for AAPL
   Date: 2025-08-10 02:28:00
   Latest Closing Price: $223.45
   SMA20: $220.12, SMA50: $215.67
   RSI: 65.43
   MACD: 2.34, MACD Signal: 1.89
   Recommendation: BUY
   ```

4. To access historical data for further analysis or plotting:
   ```python
   historical_data = bot.get_historical_data()
   print(historical_data.tail())
   ```

## Configuration

- **Symbol**: The stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple, "TSLA" for Tesla).
- **Period**: Duration of historical data (e.g., "1d", "1mo", "1y", "max").
- **Interval**: Data frequency (e.g., "1m", "1h", "1d").
  - Note: Some intervals (e.g., "1m") are only available for short periods (e.g., last 7 days).

## Example

To analyze Tesla's stock with 6 months of daily data:

```python
bot = StockBot(symbol="TSLA", period="6mo", interval="1d")
bot.analyze()
```

## Potential Enhancements

- **Visualization**: Add plotting with `matplotlib` to visualize stock prices and indicators.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Integrate email or SMS notifications using `smtplib` or `twilio`.
- **Backtesting**: Implement a backtesting module to evaluate strategy performance.
- **Portfolio Analysis**: Extend to analyze multiple stocks simultaneously.
- **Custom Strategies**: Allow users to define custom signal conditions.

## Notes

- **Data Source**: The bot relies on `yfinance`, which uses Yahoo Finance. Occasional API issues may occur; consider alternatives like `alpha_vantage` for production use.
- **Risk Disclaimer**: This bot is for educational purposes only. Trading strategies are simplistic and not guaranteed to be profitable. Always conduct thorough research and risk assessment before trading.
- **License**: MIT License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details).

## Troubleshooting

- **No data fetched**: Ensure the ticker symbol is valid and the internet connection is stable.
- **Library errors**: Verify all required libraries are installed and up-to-date.
- **API limits**: Yahoo Finance may impose rate limits; consider adding delays or alternative data sources for heavy usage.
